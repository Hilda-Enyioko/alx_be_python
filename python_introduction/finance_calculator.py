# Objective:  Use user input, variables, and arithmetic operations to calculate and provide feedback on a userâ€™s monthly savings and potential future savings without applying conditional statements.

interest_rate = 0.05

monthly_income = int(input("Enter your monthly income: "))
monthly_expenses = int(input("Enter your total monthly expenses: "))

monthly_savings = monthly_income - monthly_expenses
projected_yearly_savings = (monthly_savings * 12) + (monthly_savings * 12 * interest_rate)

print(f"Your monthly savings are: {monthly_savings}")
print(f"Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: {projected_yearly_savings}")
