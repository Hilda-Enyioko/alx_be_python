# ALX Higher Level Programming – Python Foundations  

This repository contains all my Python projects and exercises completed as part of the [**ALX Backend Development Programme**](https://admissions.alxafrica.com/home#).  

## 📌 Purpose  
The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Document my journey of learning **Python programming**.  
- Build a strong foundation in problem-solving using Python.  
- Practice writing clean, readable, and well-documented code.  
- Track my progress as I advance through the ALX Backend curriculum.  

## 📂 Structure  
Each folder in this repository represents a project or task.
alx-higher_level_programming/ 
│── python_foundations/ 
│ ├── basic_operations.py
│── README.md

- `python_foundations/` → beginner-level tasks (e.g., Hello World, basic operations, variables, conditionals, loops).  
- Each project will contain its own **scripts** and where required, its own **README** with specific details.  

## 🚀 Learning Goals  
By working on these projects, I aim to:  
- Master Python syntax and semantics.  
- Understand core programming concepts (data types, operators, functions, loops, conditionals).  
- Apply problem-solving skills to real-world coding challenges.  
- Develop discipline in **version control** (Git & GitHub).  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **Ubuntu/Linux terminal** (ALX sandbox environment)
