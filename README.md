# 🐍 ALX Backend Development – Python x Django  

This repository contains all my **Python projects and exercises** completed as part of the [**ALX Backend Development Programme**](https://admissions.alxafrica.com/home#).  

## 📌 Purpose  
The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Document my **learning journey in Python programming**.  
- Build a solid foundation in **problem-solving and backend logic** using Python.  
- Practice writing **clean, efficient, and well-documented code**.  
- Track my **progress and development** throughout the ALX Backend curriculum.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each folder represents a specific module or project in the ALX Backend track:  

- `python_foundations/` → Beginner-level tasks (e.g., Hello World, basic operations, variables, conditionals, loops).  
- `control_flow/` → Focused on **decision-making and looping structures**.  
- `fns_and_dsas/` → Covers **functions, data structures, and algorithms** (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc.).  
- `programming_paradigms/` → Focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **modular design**, and **unit testing**.  

Each project folder contains its own scripts and, where necessary, a **README** explaining its purpose, requirements, and sample outputs.  

## 🚀 Learning Goals  
Through these projects, I aim to:  
- Master **Python syntax and logic flow**.  
- Deepen my understanding of **functions, algorithms, and data structures**.  
- Learn to write **modular, maintainable, and testable code**.  
- Strengthen **problem-solving and debugging skills**.  
- Prepare for more advanced backend concepts (APIs, Django, databases, etc.) later on.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **Ubuntu/Linux terminal** (ALX sandbox environment)
